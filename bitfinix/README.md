1. Eclipse IDE
In my case I use Java with Eclipse IDE. To install Eclipse instructions can be found on https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/installer

2. TestNG
To add TestNG to Eclipse instructions can be found on https://testng.org/doc/download.html
Otherwise, you can download the TestNG jar and add it to Eclipse project as an External library.

Download the latest stable version. In my case https://selenium-release.storage.googleapis.com/3.141/selenium-server-standalone-3.141.59.jar
